# LESSON 3 INTERMEDIATE PYTHON

# Conditions

# x = 2
# comparasison 
#  is use to compare values, returns boolean value
# == ,  !=,  < >, >= <=, 
# print (x == 2)
# print (x > 2)


# x = [1,2,3]
# y = [1,2,3]
# # prints true because equal in value
# print (x == y)
# # prints print false bc not same memory address will print true it x = y
# print (x is y)


# LOOPS

# for loop
# primes =  [2,3,5,7]
# for prime in primes:
#     print (prime)

# prints 0 to 4
# for x in range (5):
#     print (x)

# prints 3 to 9 doesnt include 10
# for x in range(3, 10):
#     print (x)

# loop till 9 and last parameter is how much it will add every loop
# for x in range(3, 10,2):
#     print (x)

# while loops
# count = 5
# while count > 0:
#     print (count)
#     count -= 1


# When the loop condition of "for" or "while" statement fails then code part
# in "else" is executed. If a break statement is executed inside the for loop then the "else" part is skipped. Note that the "else" part is
# executed even if there is a continue statement.


# count = 0
# while count < 5:
#     print(count)
#     count += 1
# else:
#     print ("count value reached 5")

# for i in range ()
